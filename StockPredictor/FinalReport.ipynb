    "The stock market is a collection of buyers and sellers of fractions of company ownership. Buyers and sellers can take a variety of forms from individuals to investment firms to funds. Their goal is to understand how to make more profitable decisions with their investments. Copious data is available in the form of historical prices. These prices will be used to generate training data for machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "The endeavor of this project will be to provide return predictions for investments over a user defined period from the present day.\n",

    "Data used in this project is retrieved from the Yahoo Finance API provided through the `pandas` library. Historical data including the information of concern, adjusted closing prices, are retrieved using a company symbol, an all uppercase group of characters representing how the company is referred to in the market (\"AAPL\" for Apple). The historical adjusted closing prices are requested for all trading days in the past year up to the day the program is run as specified in the project `README.md` file."

    "Accurate predictions of future stock returns provide the opportunity to make profitable and responsible investments. Stock price movements, increases and decreases in stock value, are known to be difficult to predict. Stock prices are subject to a lot of context created by participants in the stock market. While saturated with noise, there is still information that can be exploited to make more responsible market strategies."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The metrics used to measure the performance of the models will be Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and Correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE makes sense to use in most contexts because it gives a scale of the regression error in the same units as the prediction itself. MAPE, on the other hand, makes sense to use when the outcome in question is the future stock price and not the return. MAPE gives an estimate of the error as a percentage of the overall price of a stock. Since the outcome this project will focus on is investment return (future price / present price - 1) which is normally on a scale from -1 to +1, this project will display RMSE for aesthetic purposes. In other words, RMSE displays a less intimidating view of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is also displayed to show how well the predictions tend with the true value of the returns."
